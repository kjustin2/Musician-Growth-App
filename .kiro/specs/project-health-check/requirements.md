# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on conducting a comprehensive health check of the Musician Growth App to identify and resolve runtime errors, undefined variable issues, build problems, and improve debugging capabilities. The goal is to ensure the application runs smoothly without errors and has proper error handling and logging mechanisms in place.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix all undefined variable errors, so that the application runs without runtime crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL NOT throw any "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
2. WHEN accessing any data property THEN the system SHALL have proper null/undefined checks in place
3. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL handle missing or undefined props gracefully
4. IF a required data property is missing THEN the system SHALL provide default values or show appropriate fallback UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive console logging throughout the application, so that I can easily debug issues in development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loaded from storage THEN the system SHALL log the operation and result
2. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL log the state transition with context
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
4. WHEN API calls or service operations execute THEN the system SHALL log the request and response
5. IF debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all TypeScript compilation issues are resolved, so that the build process completes successfully without warnings or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL pass all ESLint checks
3. WHEN accessing object properties THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript type guards
4. IF optional properties are accessed THEN the system SHALL use optional chaining or null checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error boundaries and fallback UI components, so that partial failures don't crash the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component throws an error THEN the system SHALL catch it with an error boundary
2. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages to users
3. WHEN optional features fail THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with reduced functionality
4. IF critical data is missing THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data initialization and validation, so that components always receive properly structured data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL ensure all required data structures exist
2. WHEN components mount THEN the system SHALL validate that required props are present
3. WHEN accessing nested object properties THEN the system SHALL use safe property access patterns
4. IF data structures are incomplete THEN the system SHALL initialize them with proper defaults

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I can continue using the app even when some data is missing or corrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN goals data is missing THEN the system SHALL show an empty state with helpful messaging
2. WHEN performance data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display available data and indicate missing information
3. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages and retry options
4. IF the application state becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL offer a way to reset to a clean state
