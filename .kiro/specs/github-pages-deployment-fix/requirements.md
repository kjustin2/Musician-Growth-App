# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Pages deployment is currently failing due to a platform-specific dependency (`@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc`) that is incompatible with the Linux runners used by GitHub Actions. This feature will resolve the deployment issues and ensure reliable, cross-platform builds for the React application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GitHub Pages deployment to work reliably, so that my application is automatically deployed when I push changes to the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL complete successfully without platform-specific dependency errors
2. WHEN the build process runs on GitHub's Linux runners THEN all dependencies SHALL be compatible with the Linux platform
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the application SHALL be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my local development environment to remain functional, so that I can continue developing on Windows without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm install` locally on Windows THEN all dependencies SHALL install successfully
2. WHEN running `npm run dev` locally THEN the development server SHALL start without errors
3. WHEN running `npm run build` locally THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be platform-agnostic, so that the application can be built consistently across different operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build runs on any supported platform THEN Rollup SHALL use the appropriate platform-specific binaries automatically
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN only cross-platform or automatically selected platform-specific packages SHALL be included
3. IF platform-specific packages are needed THEN they SHALL be resolved automatically by the package manager

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to include proper testing, so that deployment only happens when the code is verified to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN all tests SHALL pass before deployment
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the deployment SHALL be prevented
3. WHEN building for production THEN the build artifacts SHALL be optimized and ready for deployment
