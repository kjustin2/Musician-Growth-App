# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has multiple issues preventing reliable deployment and testing. The GitHub Pages deployment fails due to platform-specific dependencies, and the test suite has 6 failing tests across accessibility, service integration, React testing practices, and error handling. This feature will resolve all deployment and testing issues to ensure a fully functional, accessible, and well-tested application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GitHub Pages deployment to work reliably, so that my application is automatically deployed when I push changes to the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL complete successfully without platform-specific dependency errors
2. WHEN the build process runs on GitHub's Linux runners THEN all dependencies SHALL be compatible with the Linux platform
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the application SHALL be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my local development environment to remain functional, so that I can continue developing on Windows without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm install` locally on Windows THEN all dependencies SHALL install successfully
2. WHEN running `npm run dev` locally THEN the development server SHALL start without errors
3. WHEN running `npm run build` locally THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be platform-agnostic, so that the application can be built consistently across different operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build runs on any supported platform THEN Rollup SHALL use the appropriate platform-specific binaries automatically
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN only cross-platform or automatically selected platform-specific packages SHALL be included
3. IF platform-specific packages are needed THEN they SHALL be resolved automatically by the package manager

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass consistently, so that I can be confident in the application's quality and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN all unit and integration tests SHALL pass without failures
2. WHEN tests execute THEN there SHALL be no unhandled errors or warnings
3. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN all tests SHALL pass before deployment
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the deployment SHALL be prevented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to meet accessibility standards, so that I can use it effectively regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN color contrast ratios SHALL meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
2. WHEN navigating the application THEN proper heading hierarchy SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN semantic HTML structure SHALL provide proper context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service integrations to work correctly, so that application features function as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components load THEN achievement service methods SHALL be available and functional
2. WHEN notification center loads THEN notification service methods SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN services are called THEN they SHALL return expected data or handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React tests to follow best practices, so that they accurately reflect user behavior and don't produce warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React state updates occur in tests THEN they SHALL be wrapped in `act()` calls
2. WHEN testing user interactions THEN tests SHALL simulate real user behavior
3. WHEN tests run THEN there SHALL be no React testing warnings or errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling to be robust, so that the application gracefully handles edge cases and failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation functions encounter invalid input THEN they SHALL handle errors gracefully
2. WHEN services fail THEN error states SHALL be properly managed and displayed
3. WHEN edge cases occur THEN the application SHALL continue to function without crashing
