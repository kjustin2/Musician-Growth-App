## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI/UX issues in the musician growth tracking app that impact user experience and accessibility. The improvements focus on fixing visual bugs, enhancing the user flow after survey completion, and ensuring recommendations are easily accessible from the dashboard. These changes will create a more polished and user-friendly experience while maintaining the existing functionality and comprehensive testing coverage.

## Requirements

4. IF progress data is at 100% THEN the visual indicator SHALL display as completely filled without extending beyond boundaries
5. WHEN multiple progress indicators are shown together THEN they SHALL maintain consistent sizing and alignment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user completing the initial survey, I want to be taken directly to my profile dashboard, so that I can immediately see my newly created profile and start using the tracking features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user reaches the dashboard after survey completion THEN the system SHALL display their profile information and available features
3. WHEN a user completes the survey THEN the system SHALL NOT require them to click "Start Over" to access their profile
4. IF a user wants quick recommendations without creating a persistent profile THEN the system SHALL still provide the existing quick recommendation flow
5. WHEN a new profile is created THEN the dashboard SHALL show onboarding guidance for next steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with a profile, I want to easily access my personalized recommendations from the dashboard, so that I can view updated advice based on my tracked activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a prominent way to access their current recommendations
2. WHEN a user's activities or goals change THEN the recommendations SHALL be updated and accessible from the dashboard
3. WHEN a user clicks to view recommendations THEN the system SHALL display them in an easily readable format
4. IF a user has no tracked activities THEN the system SHALL still show initial recommendations based on their profile
5. WHEN recommendations are updated THEN the dashboard SHALL indicate that new recommendations are available

2. WHEN new navigation flows are implemented THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive test coverage for the new paths
3. WHEN visual styles are updated THEN the system SHALL include tests to verify proper rendering and accessibility
4. IF bugs are fixed THEN the system SHALL include regression tests to prevent the issues from reoccurring
5. WHEN the application is built THEN all TypeScript compilation SHALL succeed without errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain consistent visual design while fixing the identified issues, so that the improvements feel integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria
