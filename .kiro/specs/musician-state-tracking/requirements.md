# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing musician recommendation app from a simple form-based system into a comprehensive musician growth tracking platform. Musicians will be able to maintain persistent profiles, track their career progress over time, set and monitor goals, and receive evolving recommendations based on their updated activities and achievements. The system will store all data locally on the user's computer, eliminating the need for user accounts or external servers while providing a rich, personalized experience.
