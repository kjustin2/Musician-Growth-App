# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures comprehensive accessibility compliance for the Musician Growth App, addressing WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast, keyboard navigation, responsive design, and element accessibility. The goal is to make the application usable by all users, including those with disabilities, while maintaining the existing design aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want all text and interactive elements to have sufficient color contrast, so that I can easily read and interact with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any text is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
2. WHEN interactive elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
3. WHEN color combinations are used THEN the system SHALL validate all predefined color combinations meet accessibility standards
4. WHEN primary brand colors are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they are accessibility-compliant or provide accessible alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who relies on keyboard navigation, I want all interactive elements to be accessible via keyboard, so that I can navigate the application without a mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure they are focusable via keyboard navigation
2. WHEN an element receives focus THEN the system SHALL display a visible focus indicator
3. WHEN validating keyboard accessibility THEN the system SHALL detect missing focus indicators and report warnings
4. WHEN elements have tabindex attributes THEN the system SHALL validate proper usage according to accessibility guidelines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want touch targets to be appropriately sized and content to be readable, so that I can effectively use the application on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are displayed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels
2. WHEN content is displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure font sizes are at least 14px for readability
3. WHEN elements are rendered THEN the system SHALL prevent horizontal scrolling issues
4. WHEN responsive validation is performed THEN the system SHALL detect and report accessibility issues specific to mobile devices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want all form elements and interactive components to have proper labels and attributes, so that screen readers can accurately describe the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form elements are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure they have accessible labels via aria-label, aria-labelledby, or associated label elements
2. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they have proper type attributes and accessible names
3. WHEN headings are used THEN the system SHALL validate they contain meaningful content and follow proper hierarchy
4. WHEN elements are validated THEN the system SHALL detect and report missing accessibility attributes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive accessibility testing utilities, so that I can validate and maintain accessibility compliance throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility validation is performed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error and warning reports
2. WHEN color combinations are tested THEN the system SHALL validate all predefined color palettes
3. WHEN elements are validated THEN the system SHALL support comprehensive validation including contrast, keyboard, and responsive checks
4. WHEN accessibility constants are provided THEN the system SHALL ensure all predefined colors meet WCAG AA standards
