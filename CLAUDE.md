### Key Data Models

#### Enhanced MusicianProfile
```typescript
interface MusicianProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  
  // Basic musician info
  instrument: string;
  genres: string[];
  yearsOfExperience: number;
  
  // Performance data
  performanceFrequency: 'never' | 'yearly' | 'monthly' | 'weekly' | 'multiple';
  crowdSize: '1-10' | '10-50' | '50-100' | '100-500' | '500+';
  marketingEfforts: string[];
  
  // Tracked activities
  shows: PerformanceRecord[];
  practiceLog: PracticeSession[];
  goals: Goal[];
  achievements: Achievement[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}
```

#### Activity Tracking
```typescript
interface PerformanceRecord {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  venueName: string;
  venueType: 'bar' | 'restaurant' | 'concert_hall' | 'festival' | 'private_event' | 'other';
  audienceSize: number;
  duration: number;
  payment: number;
  notes?: string;
  setlist?: string[];
}

interface PracticeSession {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  duration: number;
  focusAreas: string[];
  notes?: string;
  skillsWorkedOn: string[];
}
```

#### Goal Management
```typescript
interface Goal {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'performance' | 'skill' | 'financial' | 'recording' | 'custom';
  targetValue?: number;
  currentValue: number;
  deadline?: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'paused' | 'cancelled';
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

## New User Flow

**Enhanced Flow**: Landing â†’ Profile Selection â†’ Dashboard â†” Activity Entry/Goal Management â†” Enhanced Recommendations
