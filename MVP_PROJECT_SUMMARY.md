**Step 5: Current Marketing Efforts**
- Multiple selection checkboxes:
  - Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)
  - Mailing List
  - Website/Blog
  - Posters/Fliers
  - Networking with other musicians
  - None of the above

### 3. Recommendation Engine
**Client-side rule-based system** with 15+ sophisticated rules across categories:

**Marketing & Promotion**
- Social media strategy for beginners
- Audience amplification for established performers
- Email list building recommendations

**Performance & Gigging**
- Open mic night guidance for new performers
- Venue targeting for regular performers
- Larger venue progression strategies

**Networking & Collaboration**
- Local musician connections
- Cross-promotion opportunities
- Jam session participation

**Skill Development**
- Daily practice routines for beginners
- Unique sound development for intermediate musicians
- Teaching opportunities for experienced players

**Advanced Opportunities**
- Professional recording recommendations
- Industry networking for established artists

### 4. Results Display
- **Loading animation** providing feedback during processing
- **Card-based layout** for easy scanning
- **Categorized recommendations** with priority sorting
- **3-5 personalized recommendations** based on profile
- **"Start Over" functionality** for testing different profiles

```

### Key Technical Decisions

**Build Tool Migration**
- Moved from Create React App to Vite for better performance
- Faster development server and build times
- Modern tooling aligned with React team recommendations

**State Management**
- React Context API chosen over Redux for simplicity
- Sufficient for MVP scope while keeping bundle size minimal
- Easy to migrate to more robust solutions later

**No Backend Architecture**
- All processing happens client-side in the browser
- No data storage or user tracking
- Privacy-focused approach eliminates compliance concerns
- Zero hosting costs with GitHub Pages

### Code Quality & Standards

**TypeScript Integration**
- Strict type checking enabled
- Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures
- Eliminates runtime type errors

**Testing Coverage**
- 26 tests with 90%+ coverage of critical paths
- Unit tests for recommendation engine logic
- Component tests for user interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete user flows

**Accessibility Compliance**
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML throughout
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Performance Optimization**
- React.memo for component optimization
- useCallback for function memoization
- Optimized bundle size with tree shaking
- Lazy loading where appropriate

## Build & Deployment Process

### Development Commands
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server (localhost:5173)
npm test             # Run test suite
npm run lint         # Code quality checking
npm run build        # Create production build
```

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **Automated testing** on every commit
2. **TypeScript compilation** ensures type safety
3. **Production build** with Vite optimization
4. **Deployment to GitHub Pages** via GitHub Actions
5. **Live at custom domain** or GitHub Pages URL

### Quality Assurance
- **ESLint** for code quality and consistency
- **TypeScript** strict mode for type safety
- **Comprehensive test suite** for reliability
- **Production build verification** before deployment
