# Future Feature: A Community for the Journey

This document details features to transform the app into a community hub where artists can support each other on their "Path to Stardom."

## 1. Tying Community to the "Path to Stardom"

The community features will be deeply integrated with the core progress-tracking experience. The goal is not just to have a forum, but to create a space where users can share their wins, ask for help on specific tasks, and find collaborators for their current stage of development.

### 1.1. Progress-Centric Profiles

*   **Dynamic Bio:** An artist's profile will prominently feature their current **Roadmap Stage** (e.g., "Building an Online Presence," "Booking First Tour").
*   **Shared Progress:** Users will be able to see which tasks their connections are currently working on.
*   **Showcase of Achievements:** Completed major stages or difficult tasks will be automatically showcased on the profile as badges.

### 1.2. The "Path-Specific" Community Feed

The feed will be filterable, allowing users to see content relevant to their current challenges.

*   **Content & Filters:**
    *   **Filter by Roadmap Stage:** A user working on "Recording their First EP" can filter the feed to see posts only from others at that stage.
    *   **Task-Specific Discussions:** Every task in a roadmap will have an associated discussion thread. If a user is stuck on "How to submit to Spotify playlists," they can instantly access a conversation with others who have completed or are working on that exact task.
    *   **Collaboration Calls:** Artists can post collaboration calls tagged with a specific goal (e.g., "Looking for a graphic designer for album art [Task: Finalize Album Artwork]").

## 2. Fostering Mentorship and Support

*Trigger: The community is active, and a clear gap emerges between experienced and novice users.*

### 2.1. Mentorship Program

*   **Verified Mentors:** Allow experienced artists (who have completed a full roadmap) to apply to become verified mentors.
*   **"Ask a Mentor" Forum:** A dedicated space where novice users can ask questions directly to the mentor pool.
*   **Book a Session:** A potential premium feature where users can pay for one-on-one mentorship sessions.

### 2.2. Peer Accountability Groups

*   **Concept:** Allow users to form small, private groups of 4-5 artists who are at a similar stage in their journey.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Private Chat:** A dedicated chat for the group.
    *   **Shared Goals:** The group can see each other's progress on their checklists.
    *   **Weekly Check-ins:** An automated prompt for the group to share their wins and challenges for the week.

This focus on shared progress will make the community features feel relevant and purposeful, directly contributing to the user's primary goal of career growth.
