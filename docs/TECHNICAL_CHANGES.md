# Technical Changes from Original Documentation

This document tracks all technical decisions and changes made during implementation that differ from the original documentation.

## Build Tool Change: Vite instead of Create React App

**Date**: 2025-06-30
**Reason**: Create React App has been deprecated by the React team
**Impact**: 
- Uses Vite as the build tool instead of Webpack
- Development server runs on port 5173 instead of 3000
- Build output goes to `/dist` instead of `/build`
- Configuration files are different (vite.config.ts instead of react-scripts)

## Project Naming

**Date**: 2025-06-30
**Reason**: npm no longer allows capital letters in package names
**Impact**:
- Internal project name uses lowercase: `musician-growth-app`
- Display name remains capitalized: `Musician Growth App`
- Repository and documentation maintain original capitalization

## Testing Framework

**Date**: 2025-06-30
**Reason**: Better integration with Vite
**Impact**:
- Uses Vitest instead of Jest
- Vitest provides Jest-compatible APIs
- Better performance and integration with Vite's build process

## Updated Commands

| Original | Updated | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `localhost:3000` | `localhost:5173` | Development server URL |
| Jest | Vitest | Testing framework |
| `/build` | `/dist` | Production build output |

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Performance**: Vite offers significantly faster build times and hot module replacement
2. **Modern Tooling**: Vite is actively maintained and recommended by the React team
3. **Better DX**: Improved developer experience with faster feedback loops
4. **Future-Proof**: Using current best practices ensures longevity of the project

## Migration Notes

- All React code remains the same
- Component structure and architecture unchanged
- Only build tooling and configuration differ from original plan
