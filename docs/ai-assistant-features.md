# AI Assistant Features

## Overview
This document outlines the specifications for natural language processing features that would allow musicians to update their activities using conversational input.

## Core Features

### Natural Language Activity Updates
Allow users to input activities using natural language and automatically parse them into structured data.

#### Examples:
- "I played a show last night at the Blue Moon Cafe with my full band"
- "Had a 2-hour practice session yesterday working on harmonies"
- "Recorded three new songs at Abbey Road Studios last week"
- "Made $200 from my gig at the local pub on Friday"

### Voice-to-Text Integration
Support for voice input using Web Speech API or similar technologies.

#### Features:
- Voice command recognition
- Real-time transcription
- Noise cancellation support
- Multiple accent recognition

### Context-Aware Parsing
Intelligent parsing that understands musical context and terminology.

#### Capabilities:
- Venue name extraction
- Date/time parsing (relative and absolute)
- Musical genre identification
- Instrument recognition
- Payment amount extraction
- Duration parsing

### Smart Suggestions
Proactive suggestions based on user patterns and incomplete information.

#### Examples:
- Suggest venue names based on location
- Recommend typical setlist songs
- Predict likely band members for activities
- Estimate earnings based on venue type

## Technical Implementation

### Natural Language Processing Pipeline
```typescript
interface NLPRequest {
  userInput: string;
  context: UserContext;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface UserContext {
  profile: MusicianProfile;
  recentActivities: Activity[];
  commonVenues: string[];
  bandMembers: BandMember[];
  setLists: SetList[];
}

interface NLPResponse {
  intent: ActivityIntent;
  entities: ExtractedEntities;
  confidence: number;
  suggestions: SmartSuggestion[];
  requiresConfirmation: boolean;
}
```

### Entity Extraction
- **Temporal**: dates, times, durations
- **Financial**: amounts, currencies, payment methods
- **Geographic**: venue names, locations, cities
- **Musical**: genres, instruments, song titles
- **People**: band member names, roles

### Intent Classification
- Performance logging
- Practice session recording
- Recording session entry
- Goal creation/updates
- Equipment purchases
- Venue booking

## User Experience
