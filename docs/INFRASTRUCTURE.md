# Infrastructure & Scalability Plan

This document outlines the infrastructure for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and the planned evolution of the architecture as the application grows.

## 1. MVP Infrastructure: The Backend-less Approach

**For clarity, the MVP infrastructure consists *only* of the components in this section.** All other sections in this document refer to future, post-MVP plans.

For the initial launch, the infrastructure is designed for simplicity, zero cost, and rapid deployment.

*   **Hosting: GitHub Pages**
    *   **Description:** GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs them through a build process, and publishes a website.
    *   **Why it was chosen for MVP:**
        *   **Cost-Effective:** It is completely free for public repositories.
        *   **Simplicity:** Deployment is managed directly from the codebase repository, requiring minimal configuration.
        *   **Reliability:** It is backed by GitHub's robust infrastructure, offering excellent uptime.
        *   **Perfect for Static Sites:** Since our MVP is a single-page application with no server-side logic, GitHub Pages is an ideal fit.

*   **Data Storage: None (In-Browser Processing)**
    *   **Description:** All data entered by the user (their musician profile) exists only in the React application's state in the user's browser. When the user closes the tab, the data is gone.
    *   **Why it was chosen for MVP:**
        *   **Privacy:** No user data is collected or stored, eliminating privacy concerns and the need for a privacy policy (for now).
        *   **Reduced Complexity:** Avoids the need for databases, APIs, and authentication, significantly reducing development time.
        *   **Cost:** No cost associated with databases or servers.

*   **Domain Name:**
    *   The application will initially be available at the default GitHub Pages URL: `https://{username}.github.io/{repository-name}`.
    *   A custom domain can be easily configured later if desired.

## 2. Future Enhancements & Scalability Path

As the application gains traction, we will evolve the infrastructure to support more advanced features. This is the path from a simple static site to a full-fledged web application.

### Phase 1: Introducing a Backend & Database

*   **Trigger for this phase:** The need for user accounts and data persistence.
*   **Proposed Technology Stack:**
    *   **Backend Server:** A Node.js server using the **Express.js** framework. It's a lightweight, popular choice that fits well with our JavaScript-based frontend.
    *   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**. PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database ideal for structured data like user profiles. MongoDB is a NoSQL option that offers flexibility.
    *   **Hosting:** **Heroku**, **Vercel**, or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**. These platforms (PaaS) make it easy to deploy, manage, and scale a Node.js application.

*   **New Features Unlocked:**
    *   **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and have their data saved.
    *   **Persistent Profiles:** Users can return to the app and see their previous inputs and recommendations.
    *   **Dashboard:** A user-specific dashboard to track progress over time.

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics & Scalability

*   **Trigger for this phase:** A large user base and the need for more sophisticated recommendation logic.
*   **Proposed Enhancements:**
    *   **API Gateway:** Introduce an API Gateway to manage and secure our backend services.
    *   **Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda):** The recommendation engine could be refactored into a serverless function. This would allow it to be scaled independently and updated without redeploying the entire backend.
    *   **Data Warehouse:** For large-scale analytics, we could set up a data warehouse (like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery) to run complex queries without impacting the performance of the main production database.
    *   **Machine Learning Model:** The rule-based recommendation engine could be replaced by a machine learning model trained on anonymized user data to provide far more nuanced and personalized advice. This model could be hosted on a service like **Amazon SageMaker** or **Google AI Platform**.

This phased approach allows us to start small and lean, then strategically invest in more complex infrastructure as the application proves its value and its user base grows.
